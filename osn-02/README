=========
client.py: this is the main client program. This program interacts with the 
server and other clients. The file it self is well documented throughout. 

server.py: this is the main server program. This program keeps track of where 
clients can be reached. The server accecpts queries from clients and returns 
the results. This file is also well documented throughout. 

packages: this directory holds addition files for supporting modules and classes

    __init__.py: this file is necessary for the python directory struture 
    to know that there are file to be executed within

    client_thread.py: this thread handels all incoming requests/responses 
    from other clients. The file has been well documented throughout.

    server_thread.py: this thread handels individual clients of the server 
    for server database queries. The file has been well documented throughout.

    tcp_socket.py: this is the tcp socket class for initializing and reading 
    and writing to a tcp socket. The file has been well documented throughout.

data: this directory is created by the program and is used to output and 
retreive client data suche as friends, the clients wall posts, etc.

running the program:
====================
both server.py and client.py have been made into executables. start the server 
first by:

    ./server.py --auto

Once the server has started, start as many client porgrams as you'd like:

    ./client.py --auto

The client program will ask you to register with the server, example input is
provided. Once regesitered, a list of valid commands will be displayed:

    Have Fun! =D

Items I want to fix and not completed:
======================================
In client_thread.py, line 170: when exiting the program the thread continues
to listen to the socket for a datagram. I need to create some kind of timer to 
allow the natural program flow to occur. 

I would have like to do more error checking on user input data. I do a little 
bit, but not enough. Some incorrect inputs can still crash the program. In 
addition, better user prompts and displaying of data would have been nice. 

Both the activity and error logs were never created.
