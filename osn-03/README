Client.java: this is the main client program. This program interacts with the 
server and other clients. The file it self is well documented throughout. 

Client_Thread.java: this thread handels all incoming requests/responses from 
other clients. The file has been well documented throughout.

Client_Data.java: this file handels the cilents user ID, name, address; as well
as their friendships, chats and wall posts. Additionally, this file takes care 
of file export and import.

    data: this directory is created by the program and is used to output and 
    retreive client data suche as friends, the clients wall posts, etc.

server.py: this is the main server program. This program keeps track of where 
clients can be reached. The server accecpts queries from clients and returns 
the results. This file is also well documented throughout. 

    packages: this directory holds addition files for supporting modules and classes

    __init__.py: this file is necessary for the python directory struture 
    to know that there are file to be executed within

    server_thread.py: this thread handels individual clients of the server 
    for server database queries. The file has been well documented throughout.

    tcp_socket.py: this is the tcp socket class for initializing and reading 
    and writing to a tcp socket. The file has been well documented throughout.

running the program:
====================
both server.py has been made into executables, start the server first by:

    ./server.py --auto

Once the server has started, start as many client porgrams as you'd like. This 
will work best if you import the directory "java-client" into Eclipse and use 
the run configuration arguments:

    userID firstName lastName IP port

Registration with the server will happen automaticaly and a list of valid 
commands will be displayed:

    Have Fun! =D

Items I want to fix and not completed:
======================================
I would have like to do more error checking on user input data. I do a little 
bit, but not enough. Some incorrect inputs can still crash the program. In 
addition, better user prompts and displaying of data would have been nice. 

When a user signs off and then back on there is an issue; given more time I
would have liked to of fixed this problem. 

Both the activity and error logs were never created.
